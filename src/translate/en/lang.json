  "more": "I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding my projects. Due to budget constraints, I haven't been able to deploy every project I work on. This is primarily because some projects require database configurations that cannot be accommodated by Vercel's platform. As you may know, deploying projects with database dependencies often involves additional costs and complexities, especially when using platforms like Vercel. Unfortunately, this has limited my ability to showcase all of my work online."
